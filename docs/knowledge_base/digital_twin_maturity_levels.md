9: ## Overview
10:
11: Digital Twin maturity levels classify the sophistication and capabilities of a digital twin, progressing from basic descriptive models to highly autonomous and predictive systems. The classification extends from **L0 (static replica)** to **L5 (autonomous co-existence)**, with the core operational levels being L1-L3.

15: ## Level Definitions
16:
17: ### L0: No Twin / Static Model
18:
19: **Descriptor:** Descriptive / Static Replica
20:
21: **Characteristics:**
22:
23: - No active digital twin or only a static 3D model
24: - Describes and depicts the physical entity without real-time data connection
25: - Measurements are disparate or non-existent
26: - Sensors are not interconnected
27:
28: **Use Cases:**
29:
30: - Visualisation
31: - Planning and communication
32: - CAD/BIM models for documentation
33: - Geometry and material representation
34:
35: **Key Limitation:** No dynamic behaviour or connection to the physical world.

39: ### L1: Status / Reflecting the Real with the Virtual
40:
41: **Descriptor:** Informative (Real-Time Data) / Connected - Manual
42:
43: **Characteristics:**
44:
45: - Real-time data capture from sensors
46: - Replicates the real-time state and changes in the physical entity
47: - Continuous monitoring of asset condition and performance
48: - Primary function: **"What is happening right now?"**
49:
50: **Use Cases:**
51:
52: - Real-time status dashboards
53: - Condition monitoring
54: - Performance tracking
55: - Asset visibility
56: - **FUI/HUD overlays for real-time telemetry**
57:
58: **Data Flow:** Physical Asset → Sensors → Digital Twin (Visualisation)
59:
60: **Key Capability:** Reflects current conditions dynamically.
61:

63:
64: ### L2: Controlling the Real with the Virtual
65:
66: **Descriptor:** Informative (Real-Time + Historical Data) / Connected - Supervisory / Decision Support
67:
68: **Characteristics:**
69:
70: - Real-time data + historical data or benchmarks
71: - Can indirectly control the physical entity's operations
72: - Enables informed decision-making and analysis
73: - Captures and estimates effects of real-world events using historical data
74: - Primary function: **"What should I do about it?"**
75:
76: **Use Cases:**
77:
78: - Predictive maintenance (early stage)
79: - Asset optimisation
80: - Decision support systems
81: - Supervisory control (operator-in-the-loop)
82:
83: **Data Flow:** Physical Asset ↔ Digital Twin ↔ Operator (Decision Support)
84:
85: **Key Capability:** Supports operational decisions through analysis and recommendations.
86:

88:
89: ### L3: Anticipating the Real with the Virtual
90:
91: **Descriptor:** Predictive / Forecasting
92:
93: **Characteristics:**
94:
95: - Forecasts future state and operational processes
96: - Couples real-time + historical data with ML or physical process-based models
97: - Predicts future behaviour and performance
98: - Primary function: **"What will happen next?"**
99:
100: **Data Flow:** Physical Asset → Digital Twin → ML/Simulation Models → Predictions → Operator
101:
102: **Key Capability:** Predictive analytics and future state forecasting.

106: ## Case 03 (Data Center) — Classification Justification
107:
108: **Classified Level:** **L1 (Informative / Connected)**
109:
110: ### Scenario
111:
112: Visualisation of a high-load Render Farm/Supercomputer cluster. The digital twin displays critical infrastructure parameters: Power consumption (active load), Cooling efficiency (temperature hot/cold aisles), and Network throughput.
113:
114: ### L1 Characteristics Present
115:
116: - ✅ **Asset Visibility:** Detailed "SimReady" representation of server racks, cabling, and cooling units.
117: - ✅ **Condition Monitoring:** Visualising temperature spikes ("Hot Spots") when a compute load increases.
118: - ✅ **Reflecting the Real:** The environment reacts to the simulated workload (servers light up, fans spin up).
119: - ✅ **Primary function:** Answers "Is the system stable under this render load?"
120:
121: ### Why Not L0?
122:
123: It connects the visual state of the server LEDs and heat haze to simulated data streams (Simulated "Render Job").
124:
125: ### Why Not L2?
126:
127: L2 implies active control (e.g., the twin automatically adjusting the cooling system based on data). Case 03 visualises the *reaction* of the cooling system, but for the purpose of this Showreel, it remains a monitoring tool (L1).

131: ## Project Focus Areas
132:
133: 1. **Photo-realism:** "SimReady" assets (USD) that look indistinguishable from real hardware.
134: 2. **Data-Driven Animation:** Using Python to drive thousands of LED indicators based on a CSV resource log.
135: 3. **Infrastructure Visualization:** Translating invisible metrics (Airflow, Power) into visible cues.
